    <p class="about" >
      A Life long learner with a passion for learning new technologies and applications and
       using them to solve difficult problems. I believe that knowledge is not how much you
        know but how you use it to solve daily tasks. I am at the cross roads of changing 
        careers from Biomedical electronics to software engineering and I am passionate 
        about both areas because they present their unique challenges and they also seem to intersect.
